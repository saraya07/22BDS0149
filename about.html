        <h2 class="heading_problem">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="advice_1">Academic stress and a dearth of physical activities pose significant challenges for students, impacting their overall well-being and academic performance.
         The relentless pressure to excel academically can lead to heightened stress levels, affecting mental health and concentration. 
         Sedentary lifestyles exacerbate these issues, contributing to physical health concerns and further intensifying the negative effects of stress.
         Insufficient physical activity not only compromises students' physical health but also hampers their cognitive abilities.
         The lack of a balance between mental and physical well-being can lead to burnout, fatigue, and a diminished capacity to cope with the demands of academia.
         Recognizing these interconnected challenges, it becomes imperative to implement holistic approaches that seamlessly integrate mental health strategies
         and regular physical activities into the academic routine, ensuring students' overall success and well-being.
